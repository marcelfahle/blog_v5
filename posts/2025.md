A new calendar doesn't change you.

Waiting for January 1st doesn't make it easier.

January 1st doesn't give you more discipline.

It doesn't make you wake up earlier.

It doesn't fix your habits.

It doesn't give you motivation.

It doesn't erase the bad days.

It doesn't guarantee consistency.

January 1st doesn't solve procrastination.

It doesn't do the work for you.

January 1st is just another Monday. Or Wednesday. Or whatever.

A Tuesday in December works just as well.

A random Thursday in March is just as powerful.

The day doesn't matter. What you do with it does.

Start when you're ready. Or better: start before you're ready.

January 1st isn't magic.

You are.
