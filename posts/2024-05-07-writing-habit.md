I recently signed up for Dickie Bush & Nicolas Cole's cohort-based course, [Ship 30 for 30](https://www.ship30for30.com/).

Here are a few reasons why:

### Writing improves my thinking.

By writing my thoughts down and putting the loose ramblings of the mind into actual words on a page, I have to clarify and explain. By doing that, I can quickly realize if loose thoughts are actually valid ideas worth exploring.

### It flexes my publishing muscle.

I'm a software engineer and terrible at marketing myself. I also believe that I'm huge imposter.

Instead of putting something I've built out there, I usually come up with more and more things to add or improve, or some other distraction altogether. Publishing terrifies me for some reason.

A piece of writing is a very manageable unit of work, less impactful than when someone uses and hates my software. It's much easier to hit publish and get feedback. And doing that repeatedly will help me become better at putting myself out there and being vulnerable.

### It makes me a better communicator.

Being a good communicator is an essential skill, not only in professional environments. Efficient communication can make or break all kinds of engagements and relationships. I believe that the constraint of putting my thoughts into writing will make me a better communicator.

### I practice "noticing".

That's a skill that I admire most notably on great comedians. They're able to turn the most mundane situations into engaging and hilarious stories. They notice the little things in life and realize that's something they can connect with the audience on.

So, as I walk through life, constantly alert for things to write an atomic essay or two about, I believe that I'll also flex that 'noticing' muscle

So, I hope you can join me. I'm excited to see where all of this leads.
