Every day, I write and publish an essay. It's part of a challenge called Ship 30 for 30. Some essays might seem bad, and ideas might look unfinished. That's okay. The goal is to publish.

Writing a lot helps me improve. It's like learning by doing. If I wait for each piece to be perfect, I might never share anything.

Kent Beck once said "By far the dominant reason for not releasing sooner was a reluctance to trade the dream of success for the reality of feedback." ([source](https://bit.ly/44IIZR1)) I face this fear every day.

Each essay is a chance to play with ideas. They don't have to be complete or perfect. Every piece I write is a step towards better writing. It's about getting the thoughts out there, not crafting masterpieces overnight.

This daily practice turns my thoughts into words quickly. It forces me to think on my feet and improve my skills. The more I write, the more I can say. This method might be messy, but it's effective. It keeps me moving forward and builds momentum.

In the end, it's not about the perfect essay (or software). It's about the act of writing and improving through quantity. Every published piece is progress.
