There are two sides.

The people who create.
And the people who consume.

One side scrolls.
One side ships.

Watching isn’t creating.
Scrolling isn’t building.
Streaming isn’t shipping.
Reading about it isn’t doing it.
Reacting to other people’s work isn’t making your own.

Liking. Commenting. Sharing.
That’s not creating.

Buying gear isn’t creating.
Planning to create isn’t creating.
Tweeting about creating isn’t creating.

Coding is creating.
Writing is creating.
Sketching, filming, designing, making music, publishing.
That’s creating.

And every time you create, you step over the line.
Onto the side where things are made.

That side?
It’s slower.
It’s harder.
It’s lonelier.

But it’s better.

Because in the end, you’ll forget most of what you watched.
But you’ll remember what you made.

And when you make something, even something small,
you make progress.

And progress is the part that feels like happiness.
