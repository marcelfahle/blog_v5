<p>
    November was a solid month. Nothing crazy flashy, but the kind of work that sets the stage for bigger things. Iâ€™m pretty hyped about whatâ€™s coming next.
</p>

    <h3>Stats October</h3>
    <ul class="stats">
        <li><strong>Running:</strong> 99KM / 2760m+ <small><br/>Yikes. Thatâ€™s less than October, and I didnâ€™t even break 100k this month. Black Friday took over, but no excusesâ€”December needs to be better.</small></li>
        <li><strong>Avg Wake Up:</strong> 03:31 <small></small></li>
        <li><strong>Avg Sleep:</strong> 5:56h</li>
        <li><strong>Resting HR:</strong> 43<small></small></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Still crushing the early wake-upsâ€”didnâ€™t miss a single day. Sleep and resting HR are improving, probably thanks to the cooler weather. And my Oura ring gave me a bunch of crowns this month (basically saying, "Not bad, not bad...").
    </p>
    <h3><a href="https://bold.video" target="_blank">Bold</a></h3>
      <p>This month was all about sharpening the product:</p>
        <ul class="stats">
        <li>
            <strong>New Video Demo</strong><br/>
            <small>Made a new demo for outbound efforts. Itâ€™s simple, not polished to death, and I donâ€™t hate it, which is a win. Might throw it on the landing page, too.
            <br/>(Pro tip: outbound emails with YouTube links perform betterâ€”better link expectations, less spammy vibes. Plus, embedding it here gets a few views, which makes it look more legit ðŸ’¡)</small>

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>CI Setup</strong><br/>
            <small>Not essential right now (still pre-PMF), but I added it anyway so I donâ€™t forget to run tests. GitHub Actions for the win.</small>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Search in Bold Portal</strong><br/>
            <small>Finally. This was overdue.</small>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Drag-and-Drop Uploads</strong><br/>
            <small>Welcome to 2024. Took way too long, but hey, weâ€™re here now.</small>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong><a href="https://showthem.com" target="_blank">showthem.com</a> updates</strong><br/>
            <small>By the time you read this, Robâ€™s course is liveâ€”<a href="https://showthem.com" target="_blank">go check it out</a>. I added Redis for detailed user progress tracking and made a bunch of tweaks. Smooth sailing overall, and Iâ€™m proud of what Rob accomplished with it.</small>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Finished the SaaS Academy Cohort</strong><br/>
            <small>Wrapped up the cohort. Lots of groundwork done. Now itâ€™s time to execute and make Dan Martell proud.</small>
        </li>


        </ul>
    <h3><a href="https://pidro.online" target="_blank">Pidro</a></h3>
    <ul class="stats">
        <p>Pidro ate most of my time this month, and while working in Unity is still slow, Iâ€™m glad I pushed through and got things done.</p>
        <li>
            <strong>Sent 120k+ emails</strong><br/>
            <small>Sent 120k+ emails. Got only two angry replies (a record!) and landed ~100 new yearly subscriptions. Not bad. ðŸ˜Ž</small>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Released a client update, 2.4.10</strong><br/>
            <small>Added "Restore Purchases" and a dynamic Paywall, so that we can run different prices via our CMS. Also, these were the first builds that I've cranked out and published myself. Yay!</small>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Pidro HQ Updates</strong><br/>
            <small>Added more admin tools and automation to the backend. Everything is now faster and easier to manage.</small>
        </li>



    </ul>
    <p>
        Things were, of course, bananas during Black Friday week at commercetoolsâ€”but in a good way! Tons of fun tackling interesting challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thatâ€™s it for November! During the monthly SaaS Academy momentum call, I set a goal for four Bold demos in December. Letâ€™s see how it goes!
