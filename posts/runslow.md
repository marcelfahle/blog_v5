Most people I talk to are approaching becoming a runner the wrong way.

They treat it as a grueling workout, something that has to be difficult. You have to sweat and pant, your head needs to be tomato-red - after all, it's a sport!

And while there are great benefits to high-intensity workouts, if you want to become a runner, there's a better approach. You need to slow down.

Here's why:

## Slow running is a shortcut to success

The aerobic system is your body's way of using oxygen to produce energy. It's what makes you able to sustain longer runs and workouts.

Running too fast, leading to rapid and heavy breathing, is like over-revving a car engine. It doesn't give the aerobic system a chance to work efficiently and build endurance in the first place. It also leads to muscle fatigue and decreased performance.

By running slow, you leave your body with enough oxygen to provide you with energy and build a strong foundation for aerobic endurance, which ultimately lets you run faster.

## You reduce the risk of injury

Running is a high-impact activity and puts a lot of stress on your muscles, joints and bones. Starting slow allows all these body parts to adapt gradually and safely.

## Encourages consistency

For beginners, running at a slower pace can make the exercise feel more manageable and enjoyable, which is essential for forming a new habit.

I've had conversations about this countless of times, and I know, it's embarrassing to move this slow, when you could technically "run" faster. Trust me, I've been there. When I started out, I always ran in the dark, so people won't see me.

Whatever you have to do, to get over this feeling, trust me, it's worth it.
