Bold is not a huge app by any means. You can upload or import videos, organize them, share them. That's the essence. 

But to get started, setting up your video portal, organizing playlists, setting up menus, etc., it can still overwhelm. I think.

That's why I was toying for a long time now with some sort of "Mini Bold": You upload a video, get a link or an embed code back, see some stats. That's it.

I think this could be great for Landing Page owners, documentation or just one off videos that you want to share with a small group of people. 

I was working a bit on this idea over the last month and decided to build it. I will call it Bold Spark⚡.

Initially I will keep this free to use and see how it goes. The main idea is that it might be a valuable tool that has the potential to get shared a lot and then drive traffic to Bold.

I will report back in a month or so. In the mean time, if you think this is useful, you could use this, or of you think this is total horseshit, [hit me up on Twitter](https://twitter.com/marcelfahle). I'd love to hear all about it :)
