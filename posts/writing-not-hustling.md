I write to figure out what I think. Joan Didion nailed it when she said, “I don't know what I think until I write it down.” This blog is where I want to do that – think out loud, minus the fuss about making it perfect or selling something.

So I'm shifting gears. This site isn’t for branding or reaching out for likes and reach. It’s for me, and maybe for you, if you’re into exploring thoughts without the noise.

[Joel Hooks](https://joelhooks.com/on-writing-more/) actually put this once in a way that I'm super into:

> The idea of a "blog" needs to get over itself. Everybody is treating writing as a "content marketing strategy" and using it to "build a personal brand" which leads to the fundamental flawed idea that everything you post has to be polished to perfection and ready to be consumed.
>
> Bullshit.
>
> This idea is toxic and led me to publish less and less over time.

That’s the vibe I want here. More thinking, less showcasing.

This place is for us to think, share, and maybe learn a bit along the way. No pressure, no polish. Just raw thoughts, figuring stuff out together.

**That said, if all of this resonates, or you hate it, I'd love for you to hit me up [on the twitters](https://twitter.com/marcelfahle)!**
