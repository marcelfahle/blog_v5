I learned that I work best if I write down what I think. Joan Didion nailed it when she said, “I don't know what I think until I write it down.” This blog is where I want to do more of that – think out loud, minus the fuss about making it perfect, polishing or selling something.

So I'm shifting gears, [yet again](https://marcelfahle.net/posts/2023-10-25-reboot). This site isn’t for personal branding or hustling for likes and reach. It’s for me, and maybe for you, if you’re into exploring thoughts without the noise.

[Joel Hooks](https://joelhooks.com/on-writing-more/) actually put this once in a way that I'm super into:

> The idea of a "blog" needs to get over itself. Everybody is treating writing as a "content marketing strategy" and using it to "build a personal brand" which leads to the fundamental flawed idea that everything you post has to be polished to perfection and ready to be consumed.
>
> Bullshit.
>
> This idea is toxic and led me to publish less and less over time.

That’s the vibe I want here. More thinking, less showcasing and hustle.

This place is for us to think, share, and maybe learn a bit along the way. No pressure, no polish. Just raw thoughts, figuring stuff out together.
