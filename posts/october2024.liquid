<p>
    October was a real banger, with a few significant updates (I hope). Let's go:
</p>

    <h3>Stats October</h3>
    <ul class="stats">
        <li><strong>Running:</strong> 131KM / 2160m+ <small><br/>Spend some time traveling, so less time to run.</small></li>

        <li><strong>Avg Sleep:</strong> 5:45h</li>
        <li><strong>Resting HR:</strong> 45.69</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Been hyper consistent with my wake-up times. Only the three mornings I was away I woke at 4:41, 6:10 üò≥ and 5:30. Otherwise, on the dot 3:30, every single time.

            <strong>I joined <a href="https://saasacademy.com" target="_blank">SaaS Academy</a></strong><br/>

        <li>
            <strong>Hung out with <a href="https://robhope.com" target="_blank">Rob Hope</a> in London</strong><br/>

        <li>
            <strong>Alfa y Omega went live</strong><br/>
            <small>The school that I've onboarded last month went already live a few days later. They use bold Portal! üòé</small>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>A few more leads and onboarded 3 more, "free trials"</strong><br/>
            <small>Both mostly from my extended network. But I'm grateful, even if doesn't mean anythng for my MRR. But the learnings are gold for me.</small>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Updated a few (headless) customer video portals</strong><br/>
            <small>To make sure they all have access to the new toys (AI, attachments, etc)</small>

    </ul>
    <p>
        I also went to the <a href="https://commercetools.com" target="_blank">commercetools</a> retreat in Valencia for a few days. It was great to see the team again in person!
    </p>
    <p>
        Well, and that's it. The focus in November will be going all in at SaaS Academy with my coaches and for Bold once again to get a proper demo out and get better at outreach.
        As for Pidro, Black Friday is upon us and I want to run a few deals on our in-app purchases. That'll be the first update on the unity client that I did by myself. Let's see!
